### nlohmann download link: 
https://github.com/nlohmann/json.git
### install wiringpi
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wiringpi
```

### install boost
```
cd boost_1_82_0
./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr/local
./b2
sudo ./b2 install
// until up not keep going...
cat /usr/include/boost/version.hpp | grep "BOOST_LIB_VERSION"
// if find the error

### After nlohmann is downloaded and compiled, move the nlohmann included in json-develop to /json-develop/nlohmann ÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ

### Compile Project ÔºàCMAKEÔºâ
#### Navigate to the project root directory
```
cd backend
```
#### Create a build directory
```
mkdir build
cd build
```
#### Run CMake to generate the build system
```
cmake ..
```
#### Build the project
```
cmake --build .
```
Or
```
make
```
#### Run the executable
```
./run
```

#### Close the tcp
```
sudo lsof -i :22
sudo kill -9 ID
```

##### (The packaged build file has been quarantined and will not be uploaded to github ÔºÅ)
##### (The packaged Packages include boost and nlohmann file has been quarantined and will not be uploaded to github ÔºÅ)

### if running code in terminal for single file: 
```
1. g++ -std=c++11 server.cpp -o server
g++ -std=c++11 -I../packages/json-develop -o server server.cpp
2. ./server
```
or
```
g++ led.cpp -o led -lpigpio -lrt -lpthread
sudo ./led
```
