## Project Introduction
Aircraft Cargo Balance System is an open-source system designed for managing aircraft cargo balance. This system aims to assist airlines and cargo operators in efficiently planning and managing the distribution of cargo on airplanes, ensuring a proper balance during flights to enhance flight safety and fuel efficiency.

## Key Features
1. **Cargo Management:** Provides an intuitive interface for users to easily add, remove, and edit cargo information on the airplane.
2. **Balance Calculation:** Based on the aircraft model and cargo distribution, calculates the aircraft's center of gravity and balance conditions, ensuring a reasonable balance at various flight stages.
3. **Report Generation:** Generates detailed balance reports, including center of gravity charts, load charts, etc., for reference by pilots and ground personnel.

## Technical Architecture
1. **Raspberry Pi**
   - **Sensor Interface:** Connects sensors through GPIO interfaces to real-time retrieve cargo weight data.
   - **Data Processing:** Uses Python for data processing, calculating balance conditions and generating weight heatmaps.
   - **Local Area Network Server:** Implements a server using Flask or FastAPI to provide APIs for access by STM32 and the web frontend.

2. **STM32 Microcontroller**
   - **Connection to Raspberry Pi:** Communicates with the Raspberry Pi through serial communication or other protocols to receive balance commands.
   - **Conveyor Control:** Controls the conveyor belt motor to achieve real-time balance adjustments.
   - **Sensor Interface:** Connects to cargo sensors to obtain real-time cargo position information.

3. **Web Frontend**
   - **Frontend Interface:** Built with Vue to create a user-friendly interface displaying real-time cargo balance status and weight heatmaps.
   - **Communication with Raspberry Pi:** Uses WebSocket or HTTP polling to fetch real-time data from the Raspberry Pi.
   - **User Control:** Enables users to send control commands through the interface to adjust the conveyor belt position and view real-time data.
